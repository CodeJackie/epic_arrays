../img/forebiddenKnowledge.jpg,Forebidden Knowledge,"An aisle in an enormous library, with some books scattered on the ground. The aisle seems to go on forever into the distance, and several levels of aisles are visible looking up. The ceiling is several stories high with a large window providing natural light to the library. Hovering above the aisles of books is the terrifying figure of a disembodied face. Dark, as if made by shadows, its form extends into tendrils that resemble roots or hair. Piercing dark eyes stare down menacingly, mouth downturned in displeasure, as a dark cloud of ash or mist grows beneath it."
